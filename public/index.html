			<p>Letâ€™s make the last minute gift easier than ever. Instead of going to the store, buying gift cards and sending them out manually in the mail, we can just use Gift Cards Delivery for more convenience. The database will allow Senders to send from 1 to 1,000 digital gift cards to one or many different Recipients at the same time. Such a system would have something to offer for anyone, from small business to megacorporations.

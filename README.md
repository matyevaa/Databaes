Repository for CS 340 Database GiftCards Project, team Databaes, Summer 2020.

# Project Outline
Letâ€™s make the last minute gift easier than ever. Instead of going to the store, buying gift cards and sending them out manually in the mail, we can just use Gift Cards Delivery for more convenience. The database will allow Senders to send from 1 to 1,000 digital gift cards to one or many different Recipients at the same time. Such a system would have something to offer for anyone, from small business to megacorporations.  
For instance, companies can use these to incentivize people, both externally and internally, acting as a reward for employees and as a marketing tool for potential customers. A database uniquely allows companies to organize and keep track of not only their Orders, but the information of their Recipients as well. It also will help prevent things like fraud and money laundering as it is, itself, a built in record keeper.
